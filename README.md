# Research-2023
Research for independent study

## Contents:
- **Allocation Scheme**: This is a Python project that implements the classical MVO model and the Black-Litterman-APT model within an OOP like framework.
  - **Example.py** is a Python script for a single-period MVO problem under Meucci's framework, the same as the one in Meucci_Framework_Aggregated.ipynb.
  - **Backtesting_Lab.py**: This is where I test my strategies. Run this to see the result for the empirical example presented near the end of the paper.
- **Honors Math -- Research -- Asset Allocation**: This folder contains all LaTeX-related codes, files, and images for the paper.
- **Jupyter notebooks**: This folder contains several scripts I wrote during the learning process. These cover an example of the Black-Litterman model in He and Litterman (2002) (MVO_BL.ipynb), a script for the APT model (BL_APT.ipynb), a script for Meucci's MVO framework (Meucci_Framework_Aggregated.ipynb), and a byproduct related to the Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) optimization implementation.
- **Images**: This folder contains most, if not all, of the images used in the whole project.
- **Honors_Math_Research_MVO_BL.pdf**: This is the final research paper containing all the topics encountered.

## Note:
I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Prof. Jonathan
Goodman, whose guidance and book recommendations have significantly enriched my
research experience. Indeed, there is no greater joy than having the wisdom of a mentor
lighting the path of inquiry. Thanks.
